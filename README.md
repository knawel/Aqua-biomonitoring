# Aqua-biomonitoring

I have a glass bottle (from IKEA) filled with water from nearest pool.
This bottle is isolated from environment and receive only sunlight.
The aim is measuring the parameter of this system and create self sufficient biosphere.

# Hardware

## Sensors
 I used photoresistor with R2 = 100 .. 14000 Ohm in the following scheme:
 
Vcc	 ---[==]--T---^^^^--- Grd
    	 R1   |    R2
        	  |
         	P1.1
